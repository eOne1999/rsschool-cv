### About Me

I'm a second-year masterâ€™s student in the Department of Computer Technologies and Control at ITMO University majoring in Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems. 
I created my first website for my father's business in 2014 on the CMS platform. Later, I created another Wordpress site, which I used to learn HTML and CSS. I do SEO promotion of these sites until now. Also I have experience in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. I created logos and advertising banners while working as a freelancer.
Now I have seriously decided to study front-end development and become a junior specialist.
